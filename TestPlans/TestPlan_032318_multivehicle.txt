Test Plan for multi-vehicle experiment: March 23 2018

Vehicles: Quokka, Wombat, Platypus

__________________________________________________
Load at WHOI:
* 2 x vehicles
* Black rolling case
* Laptop bag
* Big and small lubells
* 
__________________________________________________
Key parameters:

ip address: 
* quokka tail - 192.168.1.29
* wombat tail - 192.168.1.30
* platypus tail - 192.168.1.31
* payloads: check through router, or possibly use quokka.local, wombat.local, platypus.local
  > ssh mituser@192.168.1.?, pwd mitmit
* find ip for a payload:
  - open a browser (type 192.168.1.1)
  - uname admin, pwd password



___________________________________________________
Unload and set up
___________________________________________________
* Unload vehicles and equipment
* Plug in sandshark router
* Setup windows and linux laptops
* Turn on and ssh into 3 x AUVs
> ssh auv@192.168.1.29
(pwd auv)
* Check battery state- if any AUVs low, begin charging and start with other vehicles
* Check radios
* Gopros on AUVs (if desired)
* Buoys on AUVs
* Update payloads missions-lamss with new code
* Update payloads lamss-internal with new code
* Update payloads piUSBL with new code

Compass calibrations
________________________________________________________

* Run compass calibration on Platypus and Wombat

Power on payloads using windows laptop or commandline.  For command line:
> ssh auv@192.168.1.29
> SomaSend –target mcpd –name circuit.0 –value true

Open up ncv -> ahrs, check compass state
> ncv
(scroll up to ahrs- it is not visible at start, use up key to find)
(go to ahrs, -, compass, look at the values.  Turn the vehicle and see if there is the usual settling problem)

Go to a location between beams on the dock. Run the compass calibration:

1) Start ncv and navigate to the ahrs role rawmag, (ahrs,-,rawmag).  With the vehicle level (pitch and roll about 0), spin vehicle slowly in yae through one full rotation.  Note the direction that maximizes magX under ahrs,-,rawmag in ncv.  This is the reference direction.

2) Start calibration:
> SomaSend -target ahrs -name cmd.startCal -value true
> SomaSend -target ahrs -name cmd.takeCalPoint -value true

Rotate 90 degrees in heading, run:
> SomaSend -target ahrs -name cmd.takeCalPoint -value true

Rotate 90 degrees in heading, run:
> SomaSend -target ahrs -name cmd.takeCalPoint -value true

Rotate 90 degrees in heading, run:
> SomaSend -target ahrs -name cmd.takeCalPoint -value true

Rotate 90 degrees in heading, increase pitch to +45 degrees.  Vehicle should be back at original heading but with a 45 degree pitch.
> SomaSend -target ahrs -name cmd.takeCalPoint -value true

Rotate 90 degrees in heading, maintaining +45 degree pitch.
> SomaSend -target ahrs -name cmd.takeCalPoint -value true

Rotate 90 degrees in heading, maintaining +45 degree pitch
> SomaSend -target ahrs -name cmd.takeCalPoint -value true

Rotate 90 degrees in heading, maintaining +45 degree pitch.
> SomaSend -target ahrs -name cmd.takeCalPoint -value true

Rotate 90 degrees in heading, change pitch to -45 degrees.  Vehicle should be back at original heading but with a -45 degree pitch.
> SomaSend -target ahrs -name cmd.takeCalPoint -value true

Rotate 90 degrees in heading, maintaining -45 degree pitch.
> SomaSend -target ahrs -name cmd.takeCalPoint -value true

Rotate 90 degrees in heading, maintaining -45 degree pitch
> SomaSend -target ahrs -name cmd.takeCalPoint -value true

Rotate 90 degrees in heading, maintaining -45 degree pitch.
> SomaSend -target ahrs -name cmd.takeCalPoint -value true

You can put the vehicle back down now.

3) End Calibration:
> SomaSend -target ahrs -name cmd.startCal -value false

4) Look at magErr under ahrs,-,status:
> ncv
(navigate to ahrs, -, status)

Wait for magErr to settle.

4) End data collection:
> SomaSend -target ahrs -name cmd.startCal -value false

5) Check magErr and compass values:
> ncv
(navigate to ahrs, -, status to look at magErr)
(navigation to ahrs, -, compass to look at compass reading.  Reading should immediately settle when the vehicle is turned in heading- if compass cal is bad, it will take 5+ seconds.  It should take less than a second.)

Single-vehicle mission- check that everything is working
____________________________________________________________________________
For each vehicle, do the following:
1) Turn on vehicle and payload.  Boat ready to go as chase and source.

2) SSH into payload:
> ssh mituser@192.168.1.?
(pwd mitmit)

3) Load a "do nothing" mission on the windows laptop to the vehicle.

4) runtime launch: (replacing modemid 
> ./runtime_launch.sh active_shallow_sandshark no_acomms modemid=5 sandshark_deploy wave_switch

5) Deploy vehicle, chase with boat.  Confirm the following:
* Default deploy works correctly with modemid flag
* Mode switching works for relative autonomy to beacon
* Return works

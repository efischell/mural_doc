Debrief for multi-vehicle experiment: March 23 2018

--------
Platypus
--------
 - successfully runs and commanded by backseat - all working!

 - biggest issue is that vehicle has enormous trouble turning to starboard (~40-50 m turn radius, vs ~10 m turn radius to port)
    - possibly due to tether drag and pressure on fin?
    - possibly due to bad mag calibration when turning clockwise?
    - possibly due to low speed?
    - possibly due to river currents?
    
 - problems with deployment are essentially due to control issues, not sensing/acoustics
    - depth control is bad - desired depth of 1.5 m, but actual depth of 3.5-4 m
    - heading control is bad
    - see included images
    - need to tune PID gains - possibly due to payload length?
    
 - acoustic issues - generally seems to be very stable
    - all signals have similar offsets, but there is still a small delay not accounted for due to transmission of signals through the beacon
        - fix - last run of the day has the vehicle directly under the beacon - we can use this track to determine this delay
    - particles can fall into local maxima, leading to degeneracy 
        - fix - set a certain proportion (~25%) of least-weighted particles to always be reseeded every iteration
        - calculate std. devs. only for non-reseeded particles
    - signal 2 (11-9 kHz 20 ms down-chirp) and signal 5 (14-18 kHz 30 ms up-chirp) are often confused by the system, possibly due to lower frequency resonances
        - fix - we only have 4 signals to choose from on the beacons, so remove this fifth signal

  - vehicle heading appears to be quite accurate! IMU used by SandShark and its magnetometer seem to be of high quality
  
  - vehicle estimate of its speed is quite a bit higher than its actual speed, qualitatvely, according to acoustics
    - this could be due to buoy drag?

------
Quokka
------
 - appears to have an issue with its CSAC not syncing - have to open bottle and investigate
    - possibly due to disconnected/bad wiring on antenna?
 
------
Wombat
------
 - appears to have an issue with power to its hydrophones - have to open bottle and investigate

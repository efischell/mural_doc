## Henrik's Big Lubell
#### This Lubell requires wall power, and so is placed close to the entrance to the PavLab; there is a line/break in the floating dock directly in front of the PavLab, and this pinger is placed at 1-1.5 m depth on the loop closest to this break.

* (Latitude, Longitude): 42.358472053258950, -71.087382043941929
* (X, Y): 17.0499, 1.7832 (Assuming LatOrigin = 42.358456, LongOrigin = -71.087589)

## Erin's Big Lubell
#### This Lubell is placed as far East on the floating dock as possible, on the last loop, at a depth of 1-1.5 m.
#### Kayak Measured Position:
